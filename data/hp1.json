Harry felt strangely as \nthough he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of \nnew questions that had just occurr ed to him and looked instead at \nthe thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. \nFor some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and \nsilence in here seemed to ting le with some secret magic. \n“Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid \nmust have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise \nand he got quickly of f the spindly chair. \nAn old man was standing before them, his wide, pa le eyes shin-\ning like moons through the gloom of the shop. \n“Hello,” said Harry awkwardly. \n“Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be seeing you \nsoon. Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a qu estion. “You have your mother’s \neyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first \nwand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice \nwand for charm work.” \nMr. Ollivander moved closer to  Harry. Harry wished he would \nblink. Those silvery ey es were a bit creepy. \n“Your father, on the other ha nd, favored a mahogany wand. \nEleven inches. Pliable. A little mo re power and excellent for trans-\nfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it — it’s really the wand \nthat chooses the wi zard, of course.”"

I’m just going to teach you \nthe rules this evening, then you’ll be joining team practice three \ntimes a week.” \nHe opened the crate. Inside we re four different-sized balls. \n“Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to under-\nstand, even if it’s not too easy to play. There are seven players on \neach side. Three of them are called Chasers.” \n“Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red \nball about the size of a soccer ball. \n“This ball’s called th e Quaffle,” said Wood.  “The Chasers throw \nthe Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the \nhoops to score a goal. Ten points  every time the Quaffle goes \nthrough one of the hoops. Follow me?” \n“The Chasers throw the Quaffle an d put it through the hoops to \nscore,” Harry recited. “So — that’s  sort of like basketball on \nbroomsticks with six hoops, isn’t it?” \n“What’s basketball?” said Wood curiously."
