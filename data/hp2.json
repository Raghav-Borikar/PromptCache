You happen to have ma ny qualities Salazar Slytherin \nprized in his hand-picked students.  His own very rare gift, Parsel-\ntongue — resourcefulness — dete rmination — a certain disregard \nfor rules,” he added, his mustache quivering again. “Yet the Sorting \nHat placed you in Gryffindor. You know why that was. Think.” \n“It only put me in Gryffindor,” said Harry in a defeated voice, \n“because I asked not to go in Slytherin. . . .” \n“Exactly,” said Dumbledore, beaming once more. “Which makes \nyou very different  from Tom Riddle. It is our choices, Harry, that \nshow what we truly are, far more than our abilities.” Harry sat mo-\ntionless in his chair, stunned. “I f you want proof, Harry, that you \nbelong in Gryffindor, I suggest  you look more closely at this.” \nDumbledore reached across to Pr ofessor McGonagall’s desk, \npicked up the blood-stained silver sword, and handed it to Harry. \nDully, Harry turned it ov er, the rubies blazing in the firelight. And \nthen he saw the name engraved just below the hilt.  \nGodric Gryffindor."

Then Dumbledore pulled \nopen one of the drawers in Profes sor McGonagall’s desk and took \nout a quill and a bottle of ink. \n“What you need, Harry, is some f ood and sleep. I suggest you go \ndown to the feast, while I write to Azkaban — we need our game-\nkeeper back.

He ha d just reached for \nthe handle, however, when the door burst open so violently that it \nbounced back off the wall. \nLucius Malfoy stood th ere, fury in his face. And cowering be-\nhind his legs, heavily wr apped in bandages, was Dobby. \n“Good evening, Lucius,” said Dumbledore pleasantly. \nMr. Malfoy almost knocked Harry over as he swept into the \nroom. Dobby went scurrying in afte r him, crouching at the hem of \nhis cloak, a look of abject terror on his face. \nThe elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was attempting \nto finish cleaning Mr. Malfoy’s shoes. Apparently Mr. Malfoy had \nset out in a great hurry, for not only were his shoes half-polished, \nbut his usually sleek hair was dish eveled. Ignoring the elf bobbing \napologetically around his ankles, he fixed his cold eyes upon Dum-\nbledore. \n“So!” he said “You’ve come back . The governors suspended you, \nbut you still saw fit to return to Hogwarts.”"
