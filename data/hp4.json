Harry walked down the lawn toward \nthe lights shining in Hagrid’s ca bin.

There wasn’t a single cloud in the sky. Harry, \nRon, and Hermione had managed to get a compartment to them-\nselves. Pigwidgeon was once agai n hidden under Ro n’s dress robes \nto stop him from hooting contin ually; Hedwig was dozing, her \nhead under her wing, and Crookshanks was curled up in a spare \nseat like a large, furry ginger cu shion. Harry, Ron, and Hermione \ntalked more fully and freely than th ey had all week as  the train sped \nthem southward. Harry felt as th ough Dumbledore’s speech at the \nLeaving Feast had unblocked him, somehow. It was less painful to \ndiscuss what had happened now. Th ey broke off their conversation \nabout what action Dumbledore might be taking, even now, to stop \nVoldemort only when the lunch trolley arrived. \nWhen Hermione returned from th e trolley and put her money \nback into her schoolbag, she dislodged a copy of the Daily Prophet \nthat she had been carrying in th ere. Harry looked at it, unsure \nwhether he really wanted to know  what it might say, but Hermi-\none, seeing him looking at it, sa id calmly, “There’s nothing in \nthere. You can look for yourself, but there’s nothing at all. I’ve been \nchecking every day. Just a small piece the day after the third task \nsaying you won the tournament. They didn’t even mention Cedric. \nNothing about any of it. If you ask me, Fudge is forcing them to \nkeep quiet.” \n“He’ll never keep Rita quiet,” said Harry. “Not on a story like \nthis.”"

Not unless she wants me to \nspill the beans on her.” \n“What are you talking about?” said Ron. \n“I found out how she was listening  in on private conversations \nwhen she wasn’t supposed to be coming onto the grounds,” said \nHermione in a rush. \nHarry had the impression that Hermione had been dying to tell \nthem this for days, but that she had restrained herself in light of \neverything else that had happened. \n“How was she doing it?”  said Harry at once. \n“How did you find out?” sa id Ron, staring at her. \n“Well, it was you, really, who ga ve me the idea, Harry,” she said. \n“Did I?” said Harry, perplexed. “How?” \n“Bugging,” said Hermione happily. \n“But you said they didn’t work —” \n“Oh not electronic bugs,” said Hermione. “No, you see . . . Rita \nSkeeter” — Hermione’s voice trembled with quiet triumph — “is an \nunregistered Animagus . She can turn —” \nHermione pulled a sm all sealed glass jar out of her bag. \n“— into a beetle.” \n“You’re kidding,” said Ron. “You  haven’t . . . she’s not . . .” \n“Oh yes she is,” said Hermione happily, brandishing the jar at \nthem. \nInside were a few twigs and leav es and one large, fat beetle. \n“That’s never — you’re kidding —” Ron whispered, lifting the \njar to his eyes."

L ook very closely,  and you’ll no-\ntice the markings around her ant ennae are exactly like those foul \nglasses she wears.” \nHarry looked and saw that she wa s quite right. He also remem-\nbered something. \n“There was a beetle on the stat ue the night we heard Hagrid \ntelling Madame Maxime about his mum!” \n“Exactly,” said Hermione. “And Viktor pulled a beetle out of my \nhair after we’d had ou r conversation by th e lake. And unless I’m \nvery much mistaken, Rita was pe rched on the windowsill of the \nDivination class the day your scar  hurt. She’s been buzzing around \nfor stories all year.” \n“When we saw Malfoy under that  tree . . .” said Ron slowly. \n“He was talking to her, in his hand,” said Hermione. “He knew, \nof course. That’s how she’s been getting all those nice little inter-\nviews with the Slytherins. They wouldn’t care that  she was doing \nsomething illegal, as long as they  were giving her horrible stuff \nabout us and Hagrid.” \nHermione took the glass jar back from Ron and smiled at the \nbeetle, which buzzed angr ily against the glass. \n“I’ve told her I’ll let her out wh en we get back to London,” said \nHermione. “I’ve put an Unbreakable Charm on the jar, you see, so \nshe can’t transform. And I’ve told her she’s to keep her quill to her-\nself for a whole year. See if she ca n’t break the habi t of writing hor-\nrible lies about people.” \nSmiling serenely, Hermione placed  the beetle back inside her \nschoolbag. \nThe door of the compartment slid open."
