He’d probably wake up tomorrow to three fat \nletters full of sympathy and plans for his immediate removal to the \nBurrow.

I shall say no more here, but if you look at the  Daily Prophet \ntomorrow you will get a good idea of the way the wind is blow-\ning — and see if you can spot yours truly!  \nSeriously, Ron, you do not want to be tarred with the same \nbrush as Potter, it could be very damaging to your future \nprospects, and I am talking here about life after school too. As you \nmust be aware, given that our father escorted him to court, Pot-\nter had a disciplinary hearing this summer in front of the whole \nWizengamot and he did not come out of it looking too good. He \ngot off on a mere technicality if  you ask me and many of the peo-\nple I’ve spoken to remain  convinced of his guilt.  \nIt may be that you are afraid to sever ties with Potter — I \nknow that he can be unbalanced and, for all I know, violent — \nbut if you have any worries about this, or have spotted anything \nelse in Potter’s behavior that is troubling you, I urge you to speak \nto Dolores Umbridge, a really delightful woman, who I know \nwill be only too happy to advise you.  \nT h i s  l e a d s  m e  t o  m y  o t h e r  b i t  o f  a d v i c e .

The High Street was full of students ambling up and \ndown, peering into the shop window s and messing about together on \nthe pavements. \n“Oh . . . I don’t mind,” said Cho, shrugging. “Um . . . shall we just \nhave a look in the shops or something?” \nThey wandered toward Dervish and Banges. A large poster had \nbeen stuck up in the window and a few Hogsmeaders were looking at \nit. They moved aside when Harry and Cho approached and Harry \nfound himself staring once more at  the ten pictures of the escaped \nDeath Eaters. The poster (“By Orde r of the Ministry of Magic”) of-\nfered a thousand-Galleon reward to  any witch or wizard with infor-\nmation relating to the recapture of any of the convicts pictured. \n“It’s funny, isn’t it,” said Cho in a low voice, also gazing up at the \npictures of the Death Eaters. “Remember when that Sirius Black es-\ncaped, and there were dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for \nhim? And now ten Death Eaters are on the loose and there aren’t de-\nmentors anywhere. . . .” \n“Yeah,” said Harry, tearing his eyes  away from Bellatrix Lestrange’s \nface to glance up and down the High Street. “Yeah, it is weird. . . .” \nHe was not sorry that there were no dementors nearby, but now he \ncame to think of it, their absence wa s highly significant. They had not \nonly let the Death Eaters escape, they were not bothering to look for \nthem. . . . It looked as though th ey really were outside Ministry con-\ntrol now."

Do you have any evidence \nthat these meetings continued?” \nAs Dumbledore spoke, Harry heard a rustle behind him and rather \nthought Kingsley whispered something. He could have sworn too that \nhe felt something brush against his side, a gentle something like a \ndraft or bird wings, but looking down he saw nothing there. \n“Evidence?” repeated Umbridge wi th that horrible wide toadlike \nsmile. “Have you not been listening, Dumbledore? Why do you think \nMiss Edgecombe is here?” \n“Oh, can she tell us about six mo nths’ worth of meetings?” said \nDumbledore, raising his eyebrows. “I  was under the impression that \nshe was merely reporting a meeting tonight.” \n“Miss Edgecombe,” said Umbridge at once, “tell us how long these \nmeetings have been going on, dear. You can simply nod or shake your \nhead, I’m sure that won’t make th e spots worse. Have they been hap-\npening regularly over the last six months?” \nHarry felt a horrible plummeting in his stomach.

He was not sure what Siri us could possibly say to him that \nwould make up for what he had seen in the Pensieve, but he was des-\nperate to hear Sirius’s own account of what had happened, to know of \nany mitigating factors there might ha ve been, any excuse at all for his \nfather’s behavior. . . . \nSomething caught Harry’s attention: movement on the edge of the \nForbidden Forest. Harry squinted into the sun and saw Hagrid \nemerging from between the trees. He seemed to be limping. As Harry \nwatched, Hagrid staggered to the door of his cabin and disappeared"

Hagrid did not \nemerge again, but smoke furled from the chimney, so Hagrid could \nnot be so badly injured that he was unequal to stoking the fire. . . . \nHarry turned away from the window, headed back to his trunk, and \nstarted to dress. \nWith the prospect of forcing entry  into Umbridge’s office ahead, \nHarry had never expected the day to be a restful one, but he had not \nreckoned on Hermione’s almost co ntinual attempts to dissuade him \nfrom what he was planning to do at five o’clock. For the first time ever, \nshe was at least as inattentive to Professor Binns in History of Magic \nas Harry and Ron were, keeping up a stream of whispered admoni-\ntions that Harry tried very hard to ignore. \n“. . . and if she does catch you there, apart from being expelled, she’ll \nbe able to guess you’ve been talking to Snuffles and this time I expect \nshe’ll force you to drink Veritaserum and answer her questions. . . .” \n“Hermione,” said Ron in a low and indignant voice, “are you going \nto stop telling Harry off and listen to  Binns, or am I going to have to \ntake notes instead?” \n“You take notes for a change, it won’t kill you!” \nBy the time they reached the dungeons, neither Harry nor Ron was \nspeaking to Hermione any longer.

Harry was, of course, we ll used to this tactic, as it was \none of Uncle Vernon’s favorites, and on the whole was grateful he had \nto suffer nothing worse. In fact, co mpared to what he usually had to \nendure from Snape in the way of ta unts and snide remarks, he found \nthe new approach something of an  improvement and was pleased to \nfind that when left well alone, he was able to concoct an Invigoration \nDraught quite easily.

Harry looked around. \nProfessor Umbridge was sitting th ere, a clipboard on her knee, a \nfussy little pie-frill around her ne ck, and a small, horribly smug smile \non her face. \n“Sit down, Potter,” said Professo r McGonagall tersely.

Hagrid’s face \nswam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering beams and \nHarry saw that he looked nervous and sad again. \n“Righ,” said Hagrid. “Well . . . see . . . the thing is . . .” \nHe took a great breath. \n“Well, there’s a good chance I’m goin’ ter be gettin’ the sack any day \nnow,” he said."

The attack might have succeeded \nhad it not been for the fact that they unwittingly chose to stage the at-\ntack right outside a compartment full of D.A. members, who saw \nwhat was happening through the gla ss and rose as one to rush to \nHarry’s aid. By the time Ernie Ma cmillan, Hannah Abbott, Susan \nBones, Justin Finch-Fletchley, An thony Goldstein, and Terry Boot \nhad finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes Harry had \ntaught them, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle resembled nothing so much \nas three gigantic slugs squeezed into Hogwarts uniforms as Harry, \nErnie, and Justin hoisted them into  the luggage rack and left them \nthere to ooze. \n“I must say, I’m looking forward to seeing Malfoy’s mother’s face \nwhen he gets off the train,” said Er nie with some satisfaction, as he \nwatched Malfoy squirm above him. Ernie had never quite got over the \nindignity of Malfoy docking points from Hufflepuff during his brief \nspell as a member of th e Inquisitorial Squad. \n“ G o y l e ’ s  m u m ’ l l  b e  r e a l l y  p l e a s e d ,  t h o u g h , ”  s a i d  R o n ,  w h o  h a d  \ncome to investigate the source of the commotion. “He’s loads better-"

Anyway, Harry, the food trolley’s just stopped if you \nwant anything. . . .” \nHarry thanked the others and a ccompanied Ron back to their \ncompartment, where he bought a large pile of Cauldron Cakes and \nPumpkin Pasties. Hermione was reading the Daily Prophet  again, \nGinny was doing a quiz in The Quibbler, and Neville was stroking his \nMimbulus mimbletonia,  which had grown a great deal over the year \nand now made odd crooning noises when touched. \nHarry and Ron whiled away most of the journey playing wizard \nchess while Hermione read out snippets from the Prophet. It was now \nfull of articles about how to repe l dementors, atte mpts by the Min-\nistry to track down Death Eaters, and hysterical letters claiming that \nthe writer had seen Lord Voldemort walking past their house that very \nmorning. . . . \n“It hasn’t really started yet,” si ghed Hermione gloomily, folding up \nthe newspaper again. “But it won’t be long now. . . .” \n“Hey, Harry,” said Ron, nodding toward the glass window onto the \ncorridor. \nHarry looked around. Cho was passi ng, accompanied by Marietta \nEdgecombe, who was wearing a balaclava. His and Cho’s eyes met for \na moment. Cho blushed and kept walking. Harry looked back down \nat the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its \nsquare by Ron’s knight. \n“What’s — er — going on with you and her anyway?” Ron asked \nquietly. \n“Nothing,” said Harry truthfully. \n“I — er — heard she’s going out with someone else now,” said \nHermione tentatively. \nHarry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at \nall. Wanting to impress Cho seemed to belong to a past that was no \nlonger quite connected with him. So  much of what he had wanted"

The week that had \nelapsed since he had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much, \nmuch longer: It stretched across two universes, the one with Sirius in \nit, and the one without. \n“You’re well out of it, mate,” sa id Ron forcefully. “I mean, she’s \nquite good-looking and all that, bu t you want someone a bit more \ncheerful.” \n“She’s probably cheerful enough wi th someone else,” said Harry, \nshrugging. \n“Who’s she with now anyway?” Ron asked Hermione, but it was \nGinny who answered. \n“Michael Corner,” she said. \n“Michael — but —” said Ron, cran ing around in hi s seat to stare \nat her. “But you were going out with him!” \n“Not anymore,” said Ginny resolutely. “He didn’t like Gryffindor \nbeating Ravenclaw at Quidditch and got really sulky, so I ditched him \nand he ran off to comfort Cho inst ead.” She scratched her nose ab-\nsently with the end of her quill, turned The Quibbler  upside down, \nand began marking her answers.

Tonks stood just behind him, her \nbright bubble-gum-pink hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering \nthrough the dirty glass station ceil ing, wearing heavily patched jeans \nand a bright purple T-shirt bearing the legend the weird sisters . \nNext to Tonks was Lupin, his face pale, his hair graying, a long and \nthreadbare overcoat covering a sh abby jumper and trousers. At the \nfront of the group stood Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, dressed in their Mug-\ngle best, and Fred and George, who were both wearing brand-new \njackets in some lurid green, scaly material. \n“Ron, Ginny!” called Mrs. Weasle y, hurrying forward and hugging \nher children tightly. “Oh, an d Harry dear — how are you?” \n“Fine,” lied Harry, as she pulled him into a tight embrace. Over her \nshoulder he saw Ron goggling at the twins’ new clothes. \n“What are they supposed to be?” he asked,  pointing at the jackets. \n“Finest dragon skin, little bro,” sa id Fred, giving his zip a little \ntweak. “Business is booming and we thought we’d treat ourselves.” \n“Hello, Harry,” said Lupin, as Mr s. Weasley let go of Harry and \nturned to greet Hermione. \n“Hi,” said Harry. “I didn’t expect . . . what are you all doing here?”"

Sure enough, Uncle \nVernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at Mr. Weasley, but \nchose not to say anything, partly, pe rhaps, because the Dursleys were \noutnumbered two to one. Aunt Pe tunia looked both frightened and \nembarrassed. She kept glancing arou nd, as though terrified somebody \nshe knew would see her in such company. Dudley, meanwhile, seemed \nto be trying to look small and insignificant, a feat at which he was fail-\ning extravagantly."
