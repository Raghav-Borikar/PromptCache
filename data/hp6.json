Wasn’t Voldemort \nbrought up in an orphanage?” \n“Yes, indeed,” said Dumbledore. “We must do a certain amount \nof guessing here, although I do no t think it is difficult to deduce \nwhat happened. You see, within a few months of their runaway \nmarriage, Tom Riddle reappeared at the manor house in Little \nHangleton without his wife. The rumor flew around the neighbor-\nhood that he was talking of bein g ‘hoodwinked’ and ‘taken in.’ \nWhat he meant, I am sure, is th at he had been under an enchant-\nment that had now lifted, though  I daresay he did not dare use \nthose precise words for fear of being thought insane. When they \nheard what he was saying, howeve r, the villagers guessed that \nMerope had lied to Tom Riddle, pretending that she was going to \nhave his baby, and that he had married her for this reason.” \n“But she did  have his baby.” \n“But not until a year after they were married. Tom Riddle left \nher while she was still pregnant.” \n“What went wrong?” asked Harry.  “Why did the love potion \nstop working?” \n“Again, this is guesswork,” said Dumbledore, “but I believe that \nMerope, who was deeply in love wi th her husband, could not bear \nto continue enslaving him by ma gical means. I believe that she \nmade the choice to st op giving him the poti on. Perhaps, besotted \nas she was, she had convinced hers elf that he would by now have \nfallen in love with her in return. Perhaps she thought he would stay \nfor the baby’s sake. If so, she was wrong on both counts. He left her, \nnever saw her again, and never troubl ed to discover what became of \nhis son.”"

Undoubtedly, Harry thought, watching \nhim over the top of his own book, Malfoy was begrudging the time \nhe could otherwise be spending in the Room of Requirement. \nWas it his imagination, or did Ma lfoy, like Tonks, look thinner? \nCertainly he looked paler; his sk in still had that grayish tinge, \nprobably because he so rarely saw daylight these days. But there was \nno air of smugness, excitement, or  superiority; none of the swagger \nthat he had had on the Hogwarts Express, when he had boasted \nopenly of the mission he had been given by Voldemort. . . . There \ncould be only one conclusion, in  Harry’s opinion: The mission, \nwhatever it was, was going badly. \nCheered by this thought, Harry skimmed through his copy of \nAdvanced Potion-Making and found a heavily corrected Half-Blood \nPrince’s version of “An Elixir to Induce Euphoria,” which seemed \nnot only to meet Slughorn’s inst ructions, but which might (Harry’s \nheart leapt as the thought struck  him) put Slughorn into such a \ngood mood that he woul d be prepared to hand  over that memory \nif Harry could persuade him to taste some. . . ."
