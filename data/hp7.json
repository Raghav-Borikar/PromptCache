The Dum-\nbledore we knew would neve r, ever have allowed —” \n“The Dumbledore we thought we knew didn’t want to conquer \nMuggles by force!” Harry shouted,  his voice echoing across the \nempty hilltop, and seve ral blackbirds rose into the air, squawking \nand spiraling against the pearly sky. \n“He changed, Harry, he changed! It’s as simple as that! Maybe he \ndid believe these things when he was seventeen, but the whole of the \nrest of his life was devoted to fi ghting the Dark Arts! Dumbledore \nwas the one who stopped Grindelwald, the one who always voted for \nMuggle protection and Muggle-born rights, who fought You-Know-\nWho from the start, and who died trying to bring him down!” \nRita’s book lay on the ground be tween them, so that the face of \nAlbus Dumbledore smiled  dolefully at both. \n“Harry, I’m sorry, but I think the real reason you’re so angry is \nthat Dumbledore never told you any of this himself.”"

This \nisn’t love, the mess he’s left me in .
